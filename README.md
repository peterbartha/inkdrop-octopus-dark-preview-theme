# Octopus Dark Preview theme for [Inkdrop](https://inkdrop.app)

This repository contains a self-made theme for the Inkdrop note-taking app. I picked the colors of the designed color scheme with great care for better readability and bear in mind what is accessible to people with colorblindness. The theme was inspired by ocean life.

Inkdrop provides seamless data sync across devices and platforms without headache. As a note-taking app designed for developers, it is crucial to protect your data since you may store many sensitive pieces of information in it.

## Note

Inkdrop supports three types of themes: UI, Syntax, and Preview.

- UI themes style elements such as the side view, the note list, drop-down lists, and the toolbar.
- Syntax themes style the note, gutter, and other elements inside the editor view.
- Preview themes style the header, texts, code blocks, and other components inside the preview view.

You can use different themes for different parts of the application.
